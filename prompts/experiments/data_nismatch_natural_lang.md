### Client-side Issues

#### Data Retrieval
1. Instruct the model to look for incomplete or missing information from user requests.
2. Identify incorrect formatting of data queries.
3. Detect inconsistent data types in client request.
4. Investigate insufficient permissions for accessing certain data.

#### Data Sending
1. Examine incorrect formatting of data sent to API.
2. Evaluate incomplete or missing information provided by the client.
3. Analyze incorrect data type used for sending information to API.
4. Assess insufficient permissions for sending data to API.

### API Layer Issues

#### Data Retrieval
1. Investigate incorrect query syntax used in API request.
2. Examine missing parameters in API request.
3. Analyze unrecognized data format received from API.
4. Evaluate insufficient permissions for accessing certain data in the API.

#### Data Sending
1. Assess incorrect formatting of data sent to client.
2. Review incomplete or missing information provided by the API.
3. Analyze incorrect data type used for sending information to client.
4. Investigate insufficient permissions for sending data to the client.

Through this meticulous examination and validation process, we will identify potential areas of improvement in data flow and handling within the system, ensuring a more robust and efficient operation.%
